Our text adventure game

I built a complete tell-a-tale game on my own!
It has only a few rooms but it is very discriptive and has quite diffrent stories according to the choices made.
Remember to get the bad ending as it has the lore.
I had a lot of fun doing everything on my own.
I sure had to type a lot.
My code now is bugless, I think.
The game is named: tellatale_game.py.

Thank you.
